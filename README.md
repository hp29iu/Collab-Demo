# Project Name
MSCH-C220 Game Jam, November 2021 "Search For Ryu"

## Theme
“You are the closest thing to a friend” 

Our group interpreted as someone who needs help from somebody that they can trust. In result we made a a game where the character must go through obstacles to save someone. Ryu who is captured trusts Phoenix that he will go through all the instances and trick platforms through the forest to rescue Ryu. 

## Game Play
Player must reach across three levels to find Ryu (the friend). The player
however must maneuver through obstacles, enemies, and trick platforms.

W - Jump A- Left D - Right

## Impediments
Throughout the process one of the struggles was navigating through bugs whilst trying to  maintain our wanted features and design for the game. For example, we had to make sure the invisible platforms and trick platforms stayed consistent throughout the different levels. We thought it was it would be easy to implement but it was harder than expected. 

A surprise that we encountered is how were able to make the game a bit more difficulty when we added certain obstacle assets and would improve the flow of the game with the feedback of the character changing color. 

Due to time contrasts we wanted to make a final boss stage with King Dennis but adding on more juicy features and design was a challenge for us and in the end was not feasible.
